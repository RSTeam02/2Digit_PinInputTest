#2Digit_PinInputTest

The purpose of this app is how to half the number of the inputs, it's a UI study.  
Every button is paired with 2 digits from 00 to 99 and within every number with even digits can be entered.
For example the buttons 93 + 06 will output by concatenation: 9306, instead of 4 button inputs you have only 2 + confirm.
A random pin will be generated by request and by comparison with the input it distinguishes between correct and wrong.

Buttons:
+ new pin => generate a random pin
+ X => delete input
+ O => confirm input, compare
